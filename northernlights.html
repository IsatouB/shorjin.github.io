    <p>If there's one surefire way of putting life into perspective, it's to look upon the Northern Lights.
        This spectacular solar phenomenon is truly one of nature's greatest wonders, creating ethereal lights 
        in a range of colours that dance and swirl across the night sky. These apparitions have only recently been 
        understood by modern science, though have long been of inherent fascination to those who have seen them. 
        Incredible myths and tales inspired by them are woven into the cultural fabric of many societies, and Iceland
        is no exception.</p>        
        <p>As such, witnessing the aurora borealis tops the bucket list of many travellers to Iceland. Inspired by 
        incredible photographs and footage, and encouraged by travel bloggers who regard the Northern Lights as a 
        'must-see', thousands flock to this country for their chance to enjoy one of nature's most impressive 
        phenomena.</p>
